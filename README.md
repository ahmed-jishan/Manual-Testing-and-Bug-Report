Manual Testing in Software Development
Manual testing is a fundamental process in software quality assurance, where testers perform test cases manually without relying on automated testing tools or scripts. This approach requires human interaction and observation to evaluate the functionality, usability, and overall quality of a software application. The goal is to ensure the software meets specified requirements and works as intended across various scenarios.
